"""Formatting ranges over a paragraph's collapsed text, one walk per paragraph, run by run.

Whitespace collapses to single spaces and the ends are trimmed exactly as Paragraph.text does, so
the ranges produced here index into that text. A collapsed space keeps the first space's
formatting except bold, which is OR-ed (a space between two bold words is bold). The compared bold
comes from the run alone: paragraph-style and character-style bold are unresolved by design (see
tests/parity/KNOWN_DIVERGENCES.md). The paragraph style's bold rides along as style_bold, which is
drawn but never compared (like caps).

A run has one formatting, so its non-space text is one span (merged with the span before it when
the formatting is the same); only a collapsed space can differ from its neighbours, when the
bold of a swallowed space is OR-ed into it. Nothing is built per character.
