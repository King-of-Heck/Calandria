"""The flat stream of paragraph units the diff runs over.

Body paragraphs and table-cell paragraphs are one stream in document order, each unit carrying
its table location; the paragraphs of a footnote or endnote follow the paragraph that references
it (in reference order, a note's body once), tagged with their stream, so note changes fall into
reading order with everything else. Empty paragraphs are not units (they are layout, not content).
