"""Tracked revisions still inside a document.

The reader reads every document as if its tracked changes were accepted (deleted and moved-from
text skipped, inserted text kept: parser._SKIP / _TRANSPARENT). That matches Word's own Compare,
which says so in a dialog; this module gives the number the notice shows. One integer per
document: every revision element across the body, every header and footer part the document's rels
name (an orphan part no section shows counts too), and the footnotes and endnotes. A tracked
paragraph mark (w:pPr/w:rPr/w:del) and a tracked table row (w:trPr/w:ins) use the same tags and
count without special handling. Comment text is its own stream and does not count. This is a tag
scan over each part's tree, not the paragraph parse, so an inspect request for one file stays cheap.
